# Create Files and Folders With a Shell Script

## Linux, MacOS, and Windows

Create multiple directories and files, and populate files with a shell script. (Linux, MacOS, and Windows)

In this guide we'll be creating multiple directories and files, and add text to files with a shell script. You'll create and run the script. Follow the Linux and MacOS Guide if you have a Linux flavored or MacOS OS, or follow the Windows Guide if you have a Windows OS.

We'll be using a for loop to create:

* directories

* files (within the newly created directory)

* add text to files
